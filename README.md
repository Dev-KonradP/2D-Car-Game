# 2D-Car-Game
Pick Up & Deliver is a 2D car driving game developed for relaxing player experiences, offline play, easy accessibility, and no required high-end system. This game is made on the Unity game engine, which is very reliable and free to use, using C# programming language. The game has some interesting features such as speeding up and speeding down, and other car controls such as turning left and right, accelerating and decelerating. The Pick Up & Deliver is a 2D car driving game that has a menu system with options for playing and exiting the game. This whole project titled “Pick Up & Deliver” was made for learning something new and explore the technologies in field of computer science. It was solely developed by me with the guidance of my supervisor. It was a very exciting journey from starting to ending of this project. It has done with first design the game, then collect or make the game assets, then put it all into on Unity game engine, add the C# game scripts for specific tasks, add visual and sound effects, add game physics such as collide and collision, then final build and compile the game and test on different hardware.
